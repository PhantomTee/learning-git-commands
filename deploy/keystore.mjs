/**
 * Shared GenLayer deployer key.
 *
 * The key lives outside the repos, at ~/.genlayer/deployer.key, so ChainTales
 * and GenSurvival deploy from the same funded address and there is only one
 * secret to back up. Override the location with GENLAYER_DEPLOYER_KEY.
 *
 * deploy-studionet.mjs used to call generatePrivateKey() inline and never store
 * the result. Since ChainTales.__init__ sets `self.owner = gl.message.sender_address`,
 * that handed ownership of every deployed contract to a key that stopped
 * existing when the process exited — permanently disabling withdraw_protocol,
 * admin_mint_nft and transfer_ownership.
 *
 * This is a real credential: whoever holds it owns every contract deployed with
 * it. Do not commit it, paste it, or send it to anyone.
